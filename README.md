# whisper-based-live-translator
Messy live translation project based on OpenAI Whisper. 
Still working on it. Here are just the files I run. Obviously won't work out of the box. 
Check out repo made by OpenAI it's very cool. My project works by running 3 python files at the same time. Take a look for some parts that may be useful to you.

# settings 
Place where some variables are stored and used by other files. You can change how whisper works here and set translator settings.

# recorder 
Makes files for translation. (I highy recommend to record from speakers)

# transcriber 
Transcribes the oldets recorded file from a directory.

# translator 
Based on argotranslate. Run this one if you don't want to use whisper built-in translator.
